# DSA Learning with Python

Welcome to my repository for learning Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) using Python. This repository contains solutions to various DSA problems, helping me to improve my problem-solving skills and understand the concepts in-depth.

Each file in this repository contains solutions for different DSA problems. The goal is to work on problems to build a solid foundation and prepare for technical interviews or exams.

## Introduction

This repository includes a collection of Python programs to practice various data structures and algorithms, ranging from simple problems like arrays and strings to more complex ones like graphs and dynamic programming. Every problem is solved using Python and follows the best practices for algorithmic optimization.

## Repository Structure

All the Python files are stored in the root of the repository, with each file corresponding to a specific DSA problem. The structure of the repository is as follows:


---

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: All solutions are written in Python, making use of built-in libraries like `collections` and `math` when needed.
- **Data Structures**: Lists, Stacks, Queues, Linked Lists, Trees, Graphs, Hash Maps, etc.
- **Algorithms**: Sorting, Searching, Dynamic Programming, Recursion, Divide and Conquer, Backtracking, Greedy Algorithms, etc.
